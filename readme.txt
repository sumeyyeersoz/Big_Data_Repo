In this project, how the Amazon Beauty and Personal Care product reviews are useful in offering customer feedbacks is analysed. With the quantity of data, you canâ€™t afford to run these without the enough disk, CPU and RAM. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), one of the inherently powerful technologies used in Hadoop, allows data handling at large scale and Apache Spark does similar as a programming system for analysing big datasets. As Big Data frameworks evolve, distributed computing has become an essential approach for tackling scalability and performance challenges (Kaisler et al., 2013).

Our study focuses on examining diverse cloud platforms to identify which one provides the most optimized project environment. The process of ingesting data into HDFS as well as the advantages of using HDFS as the preferred storage solution will also be examined. Additionally, MapReduce and Spark's performance will be compared in large-scale data processing applications. Exploratory data analysis in Spark will help us to analysis the dataset and decision-making process.

Another step for this project is sentiment analysis. Customer reviews to classify feedback into positive and negative sentiments will be analysed. Sentiment analysis has become an essential component of modern businesses. It helps companies monitor customer perceptions, improve services and refine marketing strategies. However, working with large-scale text data presents unique challenges, such as imbalanced data, noise, and computational constraints, all of which require specialized Big Data tools to handle effectively (Kaisler et al., 2013).

In conclusion, this project aims to demonstrate how advanced data processing and analytics tools can transform raw data into actionable insights and driving smarter and more efficient decision-making processes. Through Big Data methodologies businesses transform basic data analytics to drive better decisions that boost customer satisfaction and operational performance.
